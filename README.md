In
[Legendary: A Marvel Deck-Building Game](http://www.upperdeck.com/products/entertainment/marvel/marvel-legendary.aspx),
players build a deck of Hero cards to battle against the cards coming from the
Villain Deck and defeat the Mastermind before he can carry out his Scheme.

The Mastermind wins if he completes his Scheme. The Heroes must defeat the
Mastermind four times before he completes his Scheme to win. If the Villain or
Hero Decks run out of cards before the Scheme is completed or the Heroes are
able to defeat the Mastermind, then the Mastermind escapes and the game ends in
a draw.

A card is played from the Villain Deck at the start of every player's turn, so
the Heroes are racing against the clock right from the very beginning. Some
effects can cause more than one Villain Deck card to be played on a single turn,
possibly reducing how much time the Heroes have to save the city and claim a
victory for Good.

Inspired by the
[match setup info for season 4 of Legendary Online League](http://boardgamegeek.com/article/17058875#17058875),
which includes the Villain Deck Composition and Maximum Winning Turn Count for
each match's setup, Legendary Countdown takes a given enemy setup, and reports
not only the Villain Deck Composition and Maximum Winning Turn Count, but also
precisely how many turns it will take for the Villain Deck to run out.
